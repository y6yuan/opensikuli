The evince regression test scripts were writen by following:

https://bugzilla.novell.com/tr_show_plan.cgi?plan_id=4158

Including 'Open PDF', 'Find', 'Fullscreen', 'Presentation', 'Toolbar'.
'Rotate' and 'Zoom' are under coding, since I have to find a way for 
judging whether the result is pass or not.

Now all these scripts were writen under openSUSE 12.3 which with a custom 
theme, so the icons in the scripts may not be suitable for the common
theme, since I don't use gnome. :)

And the icons for the common themes maybe coming soon.


** Bugs:

    * FindKeywork.sikuli: Finding result were be wrong if the bottom of the
    evince window reaches out the screen, that is the script can't catch the 
    key for judging the result.
